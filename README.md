# TAES

Code for the [Advanced Topics in Software Engineering (TAES)](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/if722) course.
The course used [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) to develop programs and prove properties about them.
There are Coq files for each class, with completed exercises. There is also a project that defines a tiny subset of [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processe), a traces semantic for it,
and proves the correctness of the functional definition of traces with regards to the inductive relation definition of traces.
