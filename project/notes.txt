TODO:
- Operators' associativity and level.
- Define Event type (maybe simpler at first)
- Add tau event

Questions:
- What is Set in Coq?
- How should the set of Events be represented and included in the definitions?
- How should recursion be modelled? (p. 20)
- What is Hypothesis and Section in Coq? (as in Coq.Lists.ListSet)
